# FolderLockerExample
 
The folder locker example was implemented with the Transparent File Encryption and Control Filter Driver SDK. With the folder locker you can prevent your protected files being read,written,deleted, renamed, copied out of the protected folder, allow you to authorize or deny the file access to specific user or process, also allow you to hide the files or automatically encrypt/decrypt the files on the fly.
